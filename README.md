Converting Images and PDFs to Audio for the Visually Impaired


Abstract:
This project aims to convert images and PDFs to audio files, assisting
visually impaired individuals in accessing written content through
auditory means. Users can upload images or PDFs; images can be
translated or converted to speech, while PDFs are displayed in the GUI
and can be converted to audiobooks. Key technologies used include
OCR (Tesseract), text-to-speech, text extraction, parallel programming,
MVC, Python, multithreading, and customtkinter for GUI development.
